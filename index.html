        <p> It all started when Gerardo brought to me his concern regarding the usage of cellphones in class. He realized that a lot of students at Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara were using their phones during class, thus distracting them and obstructing their knowledge.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="small-12 large-12 columns">
        <p> Then we discovered a way to solve that problem. We had to answer to the question: What do students like more than using their phones ? Answer: discounts. Yes ! So we thought of an app that would give the student a discount in some store if he/she kept his/her phone locked during the class. The method is easy, the more time you keep your phone locked the more points you get, the more points the more discounts. Here is the catch, if there are more students with their phones locked, the more points each individual student gets.</p>
